An Amiga emulator written in Rust, built around a vendored copy of
the pure-Rust [m68k](crates/m68k) CPU core, with a
[pixels](https://crates.io/crates/pixels) + [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit)
window for video and stdout for serial. It started life with the modest
goal of booting [DiagROM](https://www.diagrom.com/) far enough to show a
menu; it now boots Kickstart and runs timing-sensitive OCS and AGA software
from the regression set at real speed.

It covers OCS, ECS, and AGA (independent Agnus/Denise revisions,
programmable blanking, machine profiles from the A500 to the A1200,
CDTV, and CD32, with Gayle IDE, A2091 SCSI, and the AGA display path: 8 bitplanes,
256-entry palette, HAM8, FMODE wide fetch; remaining gaps are recorded in
the internals docs). The timing model is taken seriously: the
chip bus is arbitrated per colour clock, the Copper and blitter are
scheduled per DMA slot with hardware bus sequences, and 68000
interrupt-recognition latency is modelled. The source is organized so the
hardware model can be read and extended without chasing title-specific
patches.

## Background

It began as a two-part experiment: could I build an Amiga emulator that is
easy to drive from the command line, and could I give it the tooling to
feed debugging data and screenshots back to an AI agent automatically, so
issues could be investigated from a timestamp or a snapshot? It grew into a
larger emulator whose development was AI-driven, guided by books, my own
knowledge of Amiga internals, and test disks generated to compare timings
against real hardware.

## Features

- **Cycle-driven timing core.** The chip bus is arbitrated per colour clock
  between refresh, display/sprite/disk/audio DMA, the Copper, the blitter,
  and CPU accesses; the Copper and blitter are scheduled per DMA slot with
  the hardware per-word bus sequences, and 68000 interrupt-recognition
  latency is modelled. Real-hardware reference numbers come from the
  cross-emulator disk in `timing-test/`.
- **OCS, ECS, and AGA**, with independent Agnus/Denise revisions and machine
  profiles from the A500 to the A1200, plus CDTV and CD32. Boots the bundled
  AROS ROM out of the box, as well as Kickstart 1.3 / 2.05 / 3.1 and DiagROM
  v2.0, and runs the current timing-sensitive OCS and AGA regression set at
  real speed.
- **Configurable CPU** (68000 / 68EC020 / 68020 / 68030 / 68040) and clock,
  with an optional 68881/68882 FPU (default-on for the 68040).
- **Peripherals**: a bit-timed keyboard (6500/1 MCU), mouse, USB gamepad
  (via the pure-Rust `gilrs`, no SDL2), 4-channel Paula audio, floppy
  (ADF / ADZ / DMS, read-only SCP), Gayle IDE, A2091 SCSI, and CDTV/CD32 CD.
- **Tooling**: an in-window debugger, an interactive chip-bus frame
  analyzer, remote GDB support, deterministic save states, input
  recording/replay, and headless screenshot/frame-dump capture -- the
  deterministic core makes every replay byte-identical.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.87+ (stable). Tested with Rust 1.96.
- Fedora build dependencies: `sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel systemd-devel`.
- No SDL2 dependency. Developed and tested on **macOS**; the Linux and
  Windows paths are expected to work but are currently untested.
- **Linux requires a Vulkan driver.** The display is presented with wgpu via
  the Vulkan backend; the OpenGL fallback is not usable (see "Linux: Vulkan
  required" below). Any GPU from roughly Intel Skylake / 2015 onward has a
  hardware Vulkan driver. Older hardware (or a headless/VM host) can use the
  software lavapipe ICD: `vulkan-swrast` on Arch, `mesa-vulkan-drivers` on
  Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora. macOS (Metal) and Windows (DX12) are unaffected.

## Install (macOS, Homebrew)

```sh
brew tap LinuxJedi/copperline https://github.com/LinuxJedi/Copperline
brew install copperline
```

This builds from source on your machine, so the binary is not subject to
macOS Gatekeeper quarantine -- there is no Security & Privacy override to
click through. Use `brew install --HEAD copperline` to build the latest
`main` instead of the most recent tagged release. Then run `copperline` from
the terminal.

## Install (Linux)

```sh
flatpak install flathub dev.copperline.Copperline   # any distribution
```

Or grab the single-file `Copperline-*.AppImage` from the
[releases page](https://github.com/LinuxJedi/Copperline/releases),
`chmod +x` it and run. Both bundle the AROS boot ROM. Packaging sources are in
`packaging/`.

### Linux: Vulkan required

On Linux the display is presented through wgpu's **Vulkan** backend. The
OpenGL fallback is deliberately disabled: wgpu creates its EGL instance
without a display handle, so it silently selects Mesa's "surfaceless"
platform, which cannot be paired with an on-screen window. The symptom on a
Vulkan-less machine is the window flashing open and then exiting with:

```
ERROR copperline::video::window] pixels init failed: No suitable `wgpu::Adapter` found.
```

If you hit this, install a Vulkan driver:

- Hardware Vulkan (recommended): any GPU from roughly Intel Skylake / 2015
  onward ships one. Update your `mesa`/GPU driver package.
- Software fallback (older hardware, headless, or a VM) -- the lavapipe ICD:
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S vulkan-swrast`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install mesa-vulkan-drivers`

Copperline does all rendering on the CPU and only asks the GPU to blit one
framebuffer per frame, so software Vulkan (lavapipe) is perfectly adequate.
The Flatpak runtime already includes lavapipe, so the Flatpak works without
any extra package. Setting `WGPU_BACKEND` overrides the backend selection if
you need to force a specific one for debugging.

## Build and run

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/copperline
```

The binary looks for `./copperline.toml`; if it isn't present, built-in
defaults are used (68000 at ~7.09 MHz, OCS, PAL, real speed, and the bundled
[AROS](https://www.aros.org/) ROM on a 1 MB A500: 512 KiB chip plus 512 KiB
trapdoor slow RAM). Boot your own ROM with a positional argument, or point at a
config file:

```sh
./target/release/copperline path/to/kickstart.rom
./target/release/copperline --config path/to/copperline.toml
```

Essential shortcuts use `Cmd` on macOS and `Alt` on Linux/Windows:
`Cmd+Q` / `Alt+Q` closes the window, `Esc` passes through to the Amiga (or
closes an open menu/window), `Cmd+S` / `Alt+S` saves a screenshot, and
`Cmd+B` / `Alt+B` opens the debugger. `Cmd+J` / `Alt+J` (or the status-bar
icon) toggles joystick input between gamepad-only and keyboard emulation.
The status bar, pop-up menu, tool windows (debugger and frame analyzer),
overlay panels, save/load state, input recording, and the full shortcut list
are documented in the
[user guide](docs/guide/ui.md).

## Configuration

Copy `copperline.example.toml` to `copperline.toml` and edit; every field is
optional and missing fields use documented defaults.

```toml
rom = "kickstart205.rom"

[cpu]
model = "68000"       # 68000, 68EC020, 68020, 68030, 68040
# fpu = true          # fit a 68881/68882 (default-on for the 68040)
# clock_mhz = 14.0    # defaults to the model's stock speed

[memory]
chip = "512K"         # OCS 512K, ECS/AGA up to 2M
fast = "0"            # Zorro II autoconfig fast RAM, up to 8M
slow = "512K"         # A500 trapdoor RAM at $C00000, up to 512K

[chipset]
revision = "OCS"      # OCS, ECS, or AGA (picks the Agnus/Denise revisions)
video = "PAL"         # PAL or NTSC

[floppy]
# drives = 2           # wired mechanisms, 1-4; default is DF0 only

[floppy.df0]
path = "AmigaTestKit.adf"   # DD ADF / ADZ / DMS / SCP; omit for no disk
```

The full reference -- every key, machine profiles, Zorro boards, CD/HDD
images, validation rules, and audio options -- is in the
[configuration guide](docs/guide/configuration.md).

## Documentation

User and developer documentation -- getting started, the UI and shortcuts,
headless capture, save states, input recording, the debugger frontends
(window, headless, and remote GDB), the configuration reference, and the
internals (timing model, chipset, CPU, video pipeline) -- is published at
[copperline.dev](https://copperline.dev/) and lives under `docs/` as a
[MyST](https://mystmd.org/) project you can also build locally:

```sh
npm install -g mystmd
cd docs && myst build --html      # static site in docs/_build/html
```

See `docs/README.md` for conventions and PDF output.

## Packaging

Copperline is distributed from source. On macOS this repository doubles as a
Homebrew tap (`Formula/`); on Linux it builds as a Flatpak for Flathub
(`packaging/flatpak/`) and as a portable AppImage (`packaging/appimage/`). It
is not on crates.io: `Cargo.toml` sets `publish = false` because the emulator
depends on a patched vendored copy of the `m68k` CPU core, which a crates.io
release needs resolved first. Release steps for every channel are in
[`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md).

## What gets emulated

| Subsystem | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| M68K CPU | Via a vendored pure-Rust m68k crate; model selectable through 68040, accurate 68000 cycle counts, 6888x FPU. |
| Chip RAM | mem_map'd; reset starts with ROM overlaid at $0 until CIA-A releases /OVL. |
| Fast RAM | Optional Zorro II autoconfig RAM at $00200000 and Zorro III autoconfig RAM (`[memory] z3`); runs at the CPU clock. |
| Slow RAM | Optional A500 trapdoor/fake-fast RAM at $00C00000; arbitrated on the chip bus through Agnus like chip RAM. |
| ROM | Kickstart at $F80000 (512 KiB); optional extended ROM for CD32 ($E00000) and CDTV ($F00000). |
| Battery RTC | Read-only MSM6242-compatible register view at $DC0000; guest writes affect only emulated latch/control state. |
| CIA-A / CIA-B | I/O ports, /OVL, timers, TOD, keyboard SDR/ICR, disk control/status lines, and CIA-B FLAG disk index pulses. |
| Paula serial | SERDAT -> stdout through a one-word transmit buffer and timed shift register; SERDATR reports TBE/TSRE/RBF. |
| Paula audio | 4-channel DMA/sample playback, stereo mix, LED filter. |
| Paula DMACON / INTENA / INTREQ | IRQ bits are stored and delivered through manual M68K autovectors with modelled 68000 interrupt-recognition latency; audio and disk DMA raise completion IRQs. |
| Floppy / ADF / DMS / SCP | DF0-DF3 standard DD ADF read/write, read-only ADZ/DMS, UAE extended ADF, initial read-only SCP flux import, track-timed disk DMA, CIA drive lines, index FLAG, DSKLEN/DSKBYTR/DSKSYNC/DSKDAT, per-drive multi-disk playlists with a swap key. |
| Agnus VPOSR / VHPOSR | Beam counters advanced per colour clock; PAL and NTSC timing (including NTSC long/short lines). |
| Agnus Copper | Beam-scheduled OCS Copper with COP1/COP2 jumps, WAIT, SKIP, DMAEN/COPEN gating, and chip-bus grants. |
| Agnus blitter | Scheduled per-slot engine: normal/line/fill modes, hardware per-word channel bus sequences (including the area-fill idle C slot), BBUSY/BZERO, BLTPRI "nasty" vs CPU starvation-yield arbitration, blit-done IRQ. |
| Denise BPLCON / COLORxx | Stored and replayed by beam position. |
| Bitplane renderer | OCS lo-res or hi-res; reads chip RAM via BPLxPT; honours modulos and beam-timed BPLCON1 scroll; EHB, HAM, dual playfield, and CLXDAT collisions. Completed frames render on a worker thread by default; `COPPERLINE_THREADED_RENDER=0` forces synchronous rendering. |
| Display window | winit 0.30 + pixels 0.17 surface; 716x285 framebuffer presented at 4:3 (716x537) plus a 44-pixel status bar with power/disk controls. |
| Keyboard / mouse / gamepad | Host keyboard/mouse mapped to Amiga input paths; key down and key up events go through CIA-A SDR/ICR with acknowledge + KDAT handshake backpressure and keyboard-MCU pacing; mouse deltas feed JOY0DAT; `Cmd+G` on macOS or `Alt+G` on Linux/Windows toggles host mouse capture; a USB gamepad (gilrs) or keyboard joystick emulation drives the port-2 digital joystick (JOY1DAT directions, /FIR1 fire, POT1Y button 2); Ctrl+Ami+Ami resets. |
| OCS sprites | 8 DMA/manual 16-pixel sprites, attached sprites, composited over bitplanes with playfield priority. |
| Chip bus arbitration | Per-colour-clock OCS slot ownership for refresh, display DMA, sprites, disk, audio, Copper, blitter, and CPU chip/custom accesses, with CPU wait states. |
| ECS | ECS Agnus revisions (8372A/8375) and ECS Denise (8373): up to 2M chip RAM, DIWHIGH, BEAMCON0, SuperHires, ECS blitter (BLTSIZV/BLTSIZH), programmable geometry. |
| AGA | Alice/Lisa: 8 bitplanes, 256-entry 24-bit palette (plus the genlock T bit) with BANK/LOCT, HAM8, FMODE wide bitplane/sprite fetch, BPLCON4, CLXCON2; A1200/CD32 profiles. Remaining gaps (e.g. 35 ns SHRES sprites) recorded in the internals docs. |

The detailed architecture (source layout, the bus, the replay renderer) and
timing model live in the [internals docs](docs/internals/architecture.md).

## Tests

`cargo test` runs the unit suite, which needs no external assets. The
integration tests under `tests/` are marked `#[ignore]` because they run the
emulator against local Kickstart ROM and disk images that are not part of
the repository; they skip cleanly when the assets are absent. See
[`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for the asset list and lookup
directory, and the [headless guide](docs/guide/headless.md) for the vAmigaTS
compatibility runs. `timing-test/` is a bootable disk that measures CPU and
chip-bus timings against the CIA E-clock for cross-emulator comparison.

## Known quirks

- Lo-res content is pixel-doubled horizontally inside the framebuffer; the
  window presents the field at a TV-like 4:3 aspect plus the status bar.
- The CPU may halt with an `EXCEPTION` on an unimplemented feature (an exotic
  custom register or CIA edge case). This is non-fatal: the window stays
  alive showing the last framebuffer, and the debugger can inspect the
  halted state.
