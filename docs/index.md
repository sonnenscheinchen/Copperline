# Copperline

Copperline is a cycle-driven Commodore Amiga emulator (OCS, ECS, and AGA)
written in Rust. It models the hardware -- the 68000-family CPU, Agnus,
Denise, Paula, the CIAs, the floppy subsystem, and the chip bus that ties
them together -- rather than patching around individual software titles. The
chip bus is arbitrated per colour clock, the Copper and blitter are scheduled
per DMA slot with the hardware bus sequences, and 68000
interrupt-recognition latency is modelled. That timing discipline is what
lets it run the current cycle-sensitive OCS and AGA regression set, as well
as Kickstart, Workbench, games, and CDTV/CD32 titles.

The project home is [copperline.dev](https://copperline.dev/); the source
lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/LinuxJedi/Copperline).

## Where to start

- [](guide/getting-started) -- build the emulator and boot your first
  machine.
- [](guide/configuration) -- the `copperline.toml` reference: machine
  profiles (A500 through CD32), CPU, memory, chipset, floppy, IDE, and CD
  options.
- [](guide/ui) -- the window, status bar, keyboard shortcuts, menus, and
  gamepad calibration.
- [](guide/headless) -- scripted, deterministic runs: screenshots, frame
  dumps, scripted input, and WAV capture.
- [](zorro) -- describing additional Zorro II/III expansion boards in
  TOML metadata files.
- [](debugger/window) and [](debugger/headless) -- the interactive
  debugger window and the environment-driven headless debugger.
- [](internals/architecture) -- how the emulator works inside, for
  contributors.

## Design principles

Two rules shape every change in Copperline:

1. **Hardware first.** There are no branches keyed to game, demo, ROM, or
   file names. Compatibility problems are fixed by modelling the underlying
   chip behaviour; software titles appear only as regression examples.
2. **Determinism.** The emulated core is deterministic and independent of
   the host: a headless unthrottled run and a real-time windowed run produce
   the same emulated result when given the same inputs and media. Headless
   captures are reproducible by construction.
