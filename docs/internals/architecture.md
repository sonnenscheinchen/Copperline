# Architecture overview

This chapter is the map; the following chapters zoom into the
[timing model](timing), the [chipset modules](chipset), the
[video pipeline](video), the [CPU integration](cpu), the
[peripherals](peripherals), and the [save-state format](savestate).

## The big picture

Copperline's emulated machine runs synchronously on the main thread inside
winit's event loop. There is no emulation thread and no locking between CPU
and chipset: each turn of the loop (`Emulator::step_real`,
`src/emulator.rs`) advances the deterministic core a frame's worth of
emulated time, cycle-stepping the CPU and the chipset together. By default,
the completed-frame renderer runs one frame behind on a worker thread; set
`COPPERLINE_THREADED_RENDER=0` to use the synchronous renderer for
comparison.

The flow of a frame:

1. The frame loop hands the CPU an instruction budget. The CPU executes
   one instruction at a time through the vendored m68k core; every memory
   access the instruction makes is routed through the bus adapter and
   *billed in colour clocks* (CCK, 3.546895 MHz -- the chip bus clock).
2. Advancing the clock for a CPU access also advances everything else:
   Agnus beam counters, Copper fetches, blitter slots, Paula audio and disk
   DMA, CIA timers. The chip bus is arbitrated per colour clock, so a CPU
   chip-RAM access that loses arbitration genuinely waits
   ([](timing)).
3. When the CPU sits in `STOP`, the loop fast-forwards device time to the
   next event (timer underflow, raised interrupt) instead of spinning.
4. Render-relevant register writes (by Copper or CPU) are recorded as
   beam-position events. At the frame boundary, the bus turns the completed
   frame's events, chip-RAM snapshot, display geometry, and Agnus blanking
   latches into an owned `RenderInput`; the renderer replays that snapshot,
   never the live chipset state ([](video)).
5. In the default path `window.rs` sends `RenderInput` to the
   `copperline-render` worker while the main thread advances the next frame.
   The worker paints into a CPU framebuffer, owns the deinterlacer history,
   and returns a presentation buffer tagged with the emulated frame. GPU
   upload and winit/window operations stay on the main thread.
6. For screenshots, frame dumps, video recording, debugger stepping, and
   run-to-PC commands, the window code waits for the worker result for the
   exact emulated frame being captured or inspected. For normal interactive
   display, one frame of presentation latency is allowed.
7. For the interactive window the loop sleeps to pace emulated time to
   wall-clock; for headless captures it does not. The emulated result is
   identical either way -- pacing only schedules host work.

So an interactive run uses three host threads: the **main thread** (event
loop, core, and pacer), the **`copperline-render` worker**, and the
**cpal audio callback** that cpal owns. Only the last two cross a thread
boundary with the main thread, and both do so through owned data (a
`RenderInput`/presentation buffer over a channel, and a lock-free sample ring
buffer) rather than shared mutable state. The pacer and the audio callback are
latency-critical and can optionally be given above-normal scheduling priority
(`[emulation] realtime_priority`, `src/priority.rs`); see
[](timing) for what that does per platform.

## The Bus

`Bus` (`src/bus.rs`) owns all shared machine state: chip/slow/fast RAM and
ROM (`Memory`), both CIAs, the RTC, all custom-chip state (Agnus, Copper,
blitter, Paula, Denise), the floppy controller, the Zorro chain, and the
optional Gayle, Akiko, and CDTV subsystems. Everything routes through it;
there is exactly one owner for every register.

The CPU-visible memory map:

| Range | Contents |
|---|---|
| `$000000` - chip top | Chip RAM (512K-2M; ROM overlaid at `$0` after reset until CIA-A releases /OVL) |
| `$200000` - | Zorro II space (fast RAM autoconfig boards) |
| `$A00000` / `$BFxxxx` | CIA-A (odd bytes, /LDS) and CIA-B (even bytes, /UDS) |
| `$B80000` | Akiko (CD32 only) |
| `$C00000` | Slow ("ranger") RAM, up to 512K |
| `$DA0000` / `$DE1000` | Gayle IDE task file / Gayle ID and status (A600/A1200) |
| `$DC0000` | Battery RTC (MSM6242 view) |
| `$DFF000` | Custom-chip register window |
| `$E80000` | Zorro autoconfig window (then CDTV DMAC first on CDTV) |
| `$E00000` / `$F00000` | Extended ROM (CD32 / CDTV) |
| `$F80000` | Kickstart ROM (512 KiB) |
| `$40000000`+ | Zorro III space (32-bit CPUs) |

MMIO stubs cover every "gap" region DiagROM probes during fast-RAM
detection, so probing software sees bus-like behaviour everywhere.

A CPU read of an address no region claims floats to the last value the
chip data bus carried (`Bus.data_bus`, fed by the live display and audio
DMA fetches), as on real Agnus-arbitrated hardware -- not a fixed all-ones
pattern; on a blank screen that value is 0. The constant matters: software
that chases a pointer off into unmapped space (e.g. a filesystem walking a
corrupted buffer-cache chain) can loop forever on a fixed value, where the
ever-changing floating value lets the chase wander to a zero terminator as
on silicon. Device windows that decode their own floating bus keep their
own values -- e.g. the A2091 board's unpopulated XT-interface bytes read
`$FF` from its own model, not the chip data bus.

## Determinism and the host boundary

The core's only inputs are the config, the loaded images, and the
timestamped input events (host keyboard/mouse/gamepad in windowed runs;
`--press-after`-style scripted events in headless runs). Audio is rendered
in emulated time and resampled at the host boundary; wall-clock affects
scheduling only. This is what makes `--screenshot-after` runs exactly
reproducible, lets the headless debugger replay a failure
deterministically, and makes [save states](savestate) exact: a restored
run is byte-identical to one that was never interrupted.

The one host-clock value that reaches emulated state is the battery RTC: a
guest that reads it (`$DC0000`) sees the host date and time, so RTC reads
are not reproducible across wall-clock runs. `COPPERLINE_RTC_FIXED_SECS=`
*unix-seconds* pins the clock to a fixed value, which is what makes
differential traces against another emulator line up.

### Input scripting and recording (`inputrec.rs`)

Scripted input (`--press-after` and friends, or a `--script` file) fires
at the first frame boundary at-or-after each event's emulated timestamp.
The input recorder (window shortcut / `--record-input`) produces those
scripts from a live session by combining two capture styles: direct
hooks where event identity matters (the keyboard choke point
`handle_amiga_key_event`, floppy inserts) and a once-per-quantum diff of
the live `InputState` for port-1 mouse buttons, mouse motion (wrapped
quadrature-counter deltas become `mouse-after` directives), and the
port-2 joystick/CD32 pad. Two details keep record-then-replay
byte-identical: recorded timestamps are the emulated times the events
were *applied* (frame boundaries, not the wall-clock moment the host
delivered them), and times/holds are floored -- never rounded -- to
milliseconds, because rounding a boundary time up would push the
replayed event one frame late. The end-to-end gate is the same as for
save states: record a scripted run, replay the recording, `cmp` the
screenshots. User-facing usage is in
[](../guide/headless.md#input-recording-and-script-files).

## envcfg: environment variables are start-up settings

All `COPPERLINE_*` knobs are read through `src/envcfg.rs`, which snapshots
the entire environment once into a static map on first access. Hot paths
(per-instruction, per-cycle) consult these knobs; a live `std::env::var`
call there would take the process-wide environment lock millions of times a
second and starve the audio thread of the same lock.

Three consequences for contributors:

- Never call `std::env::var*` for a `COPPERLINE_*` knob -- use
  `envcfg::flag` / `envcfg::var`.
- Values cannot change at runtime; every knob is a start-up setting.
- On genuinely hot paths (per pixel, per colour clock, per device tick),
  even `envcfg::flag`/`envcfg::var` are too expensive: each call hashes the
  variable name to probe the snapshot map. Cache the value once through a
  `OnceLock` helper next to the call site -- see `dbg_cia_on()` and
  `no_disk_stall()` in `src/bus.rs` or `clamp_planes_setting()` in
  `src/video/bitplane.rs` for the pattern. (A per-pixel `envcfg::var` call
  in the playfield decoder once cost ~20% of total host CPU.)
