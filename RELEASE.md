# Release Checklist

Copperline is currently released from source. The crate is marked
`publish = false` because it depends on a patched vendored copy of `m68k`;
resolve that dependency story before attempting a crates.io release.

## Before Creating the Public Repository

1. Create the public repository from a clean tree with rewritten history.
2. Confirm the tracked tree has no copyrighted ROM, disk, hard-disk, or CD
   images:

   ```sh
   git status --short
   git ls-files | rg -n '\.(rom|ROM|adf|ADF|adz|ADZ|dms|DMS|hdf|HDF|scp|SCP|cue|CUE|bin|BIN|iso|ISO|u12|U12|u13|U13|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|pdf|zip|7z|lha|lzx)$'
   ```

   Expected tracked binary files are:

   - `assets/brand/*.png`
   - `docs/images/*.png`; review provenance before release when these change
   - `timing-test/boot.bin`, built from `timing-test/boot.asm`
   - `vendor/m68k/tests/fixtures/extra/**/bin/*.bin`, built from the
     adjacent assembly sources under sibling `src/` directories

3. Confirm local assets are still ignored:

   ```sh
   git check-ignore -v KICK13.ROM AmigaTestKit.adf cdtv_single.bin
   ```

## Checks

Run these before tagging a source release:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
```

Build the documentation:

```sh
cd docs
myst build --html --ci --strict --check-links
myst build --pdf --ci --strict
test -s _build/exports/copperline.pdf
```

## Homebrew formula

This repository is its own Homebrew tap (`Formula/copperline.rb`). After
tagging a release, update the formula so `brew install copperline` picks up
the new version:

```sh
VER=X.Y.Z
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/LinuxJedi/Copperline/archive/refs/tags/v$VER.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256
```

Set `url` to the `v$VER.tar.gz` tarball and `sha256` to the printed digest.
Smoke-test the formula locally before pushing:

```sh
brew install --build-from-source ./Formula/copperline.rb
brew test copperline
brew audit --strict --formula ./Formula/copperline.rb
```

## Linux: Flatpak and AppImage

Linux distribution uses two channels (see `packaging/`).

**Flatpak / Flathub** (`packaging/flatpak/`) is the primary channel. After a
release commit lands, refresh the vendored crate list if dependencies changed
and point the manifest at the tag:

```sh
./packaging/flatpak/generate-cargo-sources.sh   # if Cargo.lock changed
```

Set `tag:` and `commit:` in `dev.copperline.Copperline.yaml` to the release,
add a `<release>` entry to `dev.copperline.Copperline.metainfo.xml`, then push
the same change to the `flathub/dev.copperline.Copperline` repository (the
Flathub app repo created at first acceptance). The `Flatpak` workflow builds
and lints the bundle the same way Flathub does. First-time submission steps are
in `packaging/flatpak/README.md`.

**AppImage** (`packaging/appimage/`) is the no-install fallback. The `AppImage`
workflow builds it on `ubuntu-22.04` and, on a `v*` tag, attaches
`Copperline-X.Y.Z-<arch>.AppImage` to the GitHub Release automatically. To
build one by hand on a Linux host:

```sh
./packaging/appimage/build-appimage.sh
```

## Crate packaging

`cargo package --no-verify --offline` can be used to inspect the source
archive layout after the dependencies are cached. Do not use full package
verification as a release gate until the vendored `m68k` path dependency has
a crates.io-compatible replacement.
