//! Amiga keyboard MCU (6500/1) model: bit-timed KCLK/KDAT serial path
//! into CIA-A.
//!
//! A real Amiga keyboard is a microcontroller that scans the key matrix
//! and clocks each event to the machine over two open-drain lines: KCLK
//! (wired to CIA-A CNT) and KDAT (wired to CIA-A SP). The CIA shifts the
//! KDAT level into SDR on every KCLK rising edge and raises the SP
//! interrupt after eight bits. This module models that MCU as a state
//! machine on the emulated clock; nothing is injected into SDR directly.
//!
//! Protocol reference: the HRM keyboard appendix, cross-checked against
//! real-hardware-validated replacement keyboard-controller firmware
//! (A500KBFirmware: send_data/sync_with_computer/run_reset/main_loop in
//! common/ drive actual Amigas through this exact protocol).
//!
//! - Every byte (key events and status codes alike) is rotated left one
//!   position and sent MSB-first with logical 1 driving KDAT low. The
//!   CIA shifts the raw KDAT pin level into SDR, so SDR ends up holding
//!   the inverted rotated value -- which software decodes with `ror.b` +
//!   `not.b`. For a key event the logical value is
//!   `(up_down << 7) | keycode`, so SDR holds
//!   `~((keycode << 1) | up_down)`.
//! - Each bit cell is three 20 us phases: KDAT asserted (data setup),
//!   KCLK low, KCLK high. The CIA samples KDAT on the KCLK low->high
//!   edge. A byte takes ~480 us; KCLK idles high.
//! - After the 8th bit the keyboard releases KDAT and waits for the
//!   handshake: the Amiga drives KDAT low (CIA-A SPMODE output mode).
//!   The 6500/1 polls slowly, so the pulse must last at least 85 us;
//!   shorter pulses are ignored (the replacement firmware polls faster
//!   and accepts shorter ones -- we model the original part).
//! - No handshake within 143 ms -> lost sync: the keyboard clocks out a
//!   single logical-1 bit (KDAT low) and waits another 143 ms, repeating
//!   until a bit is handshaked; it then sends $F9 ("last key code bad")
//!   followed by a retransmission of the lost event (HRM; the
//!   replacement firmware sends $F9 without the retransmission).
//! - Power-up / post-reset: after self-test the keyboard synchronizes
//!   with the same lone-bit procedure, then sends $FD ("initiate
//!   power-up key stream"), the codes of keys already held, and $FE
//!   ("terminate key stream"). Power-up bytes do not retry on a missed
//!   handshake (matching the firmware's ignored send results).
//! - Ctrl + both Amiga keys: the keyboard sends $78 (reset warning),
//!   and if it is handshaked, a second $78 with up to 250 ms for the
//!   processor to acknowledge; it then pulls KCLK low for >= 500 ms,
//!   hard-resetting the machine, and restarts its own power-up flow.
